In this release, we leveraged AI to ensure our code adhered to best practices and to efficiently reference specific method calls. Additionally, we used AI to assist in generating some of the Javadoc documentation. However, the actual code was written by the team without AI involvement. Overall, AI enabled us to work in a more streamlined and efficient manner, improving our workflow.
