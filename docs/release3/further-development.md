If we were to continue developing the application, there are several features and improvements that could be made. Here are some suggestions for further development:

## Search functionality

Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for books by title, author, genre, or other criteria. This would make it easier for users to find books they are interested in.

## User authentication

Currently, the application only supports logging in with NTNU email. To make the application more accessible, we could add support for other login methods, such as Google or Facebook.

## User roles

To improve security and access control, we could implement user roles with different permissions. For example, we could have an admin role that can manage the library and users, and a regular user role that can only read books.

## Book recommendations

To enhance the user experience, we could implement a recommendation system that suggests books based on the user's reading history or preferences.

## Personal libraries

Allow users to create personal libraries where they can store their favorite books or books they are currently reading.
