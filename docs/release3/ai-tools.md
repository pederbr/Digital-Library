In this release, we used AI to ensure our code adhered to best practices and to efficiently reference specific method calls. LLMs like GitHub Copilot and Claude are great sparring partners, that have helped us understand a lot of concepts and methods we would not have thought of ourselves.

Additionally, we used AI to assist in generating some of the Javadoc documentation. Overall, AI enabled us to work in a more streamlined and efficient manner, improving our workflow.

We also used AI to help us create unit tests. This allowed us to ensure that our code was robust and that it worked as intended.

In summary, AI played a crucial role in this release by helping us write better code, help us create tests, and create documentation. By actively using AI tools, we were able to work more efficiently, ultimately improving the quality of our project.
