## How we worked during development

- **Weekly meetings**: The team has two meetings a week and more when needed close to new releases.
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes are reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged.
- **Pair Programming**: We use pair programming for complex tasks and bug fixes.
- **Version Control**: We have automated both commit message structure, issue descriptions and merge requests descriptions. This makes it easy to track what has been done. Our main branch is set to protected and it is only possible to add new changes by creating merge requests.
- **Collaboration**: We use Notion as the main platform for collaboration outside of Git and GitLab, and Messenger as our means of communication.
- **Task Management**: Tasks are tracked, prioritized, and assigned using GitLab Milestones and Issues. Each issue is assigned to a team member and has a label indicating what type of task it is. Branches are created from the issue and the issue is closed when the branch is merged.
