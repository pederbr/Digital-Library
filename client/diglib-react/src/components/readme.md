## Overview

The Components module contains the front-end components of the React client, which are reusable UI elements that are used across the application. These components are built using React and styled with CSS. They provide a consistent look and feel to the application, and help to maintain a clean and organized codebase.

There are three main tabs in the application:
- **Books**: Displays a list of all books in the library.
- **View**: Allows users to view the contents of a selected book. The user can also download the book to their local machine, or delete the book from the library. Aswell as go to specific page.
- **Upload**: Enables users to upload a new book to the library.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Provides a graphical interface for interacting with the DigLib application.
- **Book Management**: Allows users to upload, download, view, and delete books through the UI.
- **Genre Management**: Enables users to manage and filter book genres.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages and handles user actions gracefully.
